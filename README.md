# A JavaScript based Website of UFO sighting

## OVERVIEW
In this assignment I must help a data journalist name Dana creating a webpage that can show information on all. The goal of this project is delivered on searchable web page that can show list of UFO sighting and it could be narrowed down based on date, city, state, country, and shape. The tool used in this assignment were JavaScript, CSS and HTML. We had data table of first 13 days of 2010 to look and post t the site and analyze it. 

## ANALYSIS
In first 13 days of 2010 there were 111 sightnings. Therefore, there is enough data to support existence of UFO. As we get mores sigtning report more data will be added to data.js, which holds all the data of sightings, the webpage will be updates as well. app.js is there to work as search engine and filter to generate table and filter results.  


## RESULTS

By default, all lines in the tables are visible on one page. When we search by date, city, state, country, or shape, or any combination of those criteria, the search filters and shows relevant report. See below for examples

Searching for two filters, state (California) and shape (triangle)

## SUMMARY

While it is a nice basic website and with quite a lot of evidence of UFO sighting, there are few things that could improve this site. 
1. The table is too big for one page. People should be able to limit view by 20 or records per page. 
2. A reset button that resets search filter would be helpful. 
3. since there is only 111 records then a .js file is acceptable. However, when you have thousands of records then a database will be needed. 

However, the site is functional and looks usable and itwas fun creating it.
